# What is Septic

Septic (Server Environment for ProTab Informatics Contest) is a tool
providing run time environment for computer science contests. The attendees
solve tasks by writing a program in Python. The Python program is uploaded
to a server (the expected mode of operation is the server providing a web
based code editor) and run there in a sandboxed environment.

The task specifies what objects (functions, classes, ...) are exported to
the sandboxed program and its maximum run time.
